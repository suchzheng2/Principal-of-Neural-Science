# Introduction
* Behaviors are shaped by the interpaly of genes and enviroment
* RNA and proteins encoded by genes affect brains - at different times and at many levels,
  * e.g. developmental program, synapes' neural circuit function
* Goal of the chapter: How genes contribute to behavior
* Chapter table of content
  1. Overview of the evidence that genese influcence behavior
  2. review basic principal of molecular biology and genetic transmission
  3. Examples
  4. Recent progress

# Evidence that genes influcence behavior 
* **Twin studies**
  * Monozygotic twins: Identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg, share all genes
  * Fraternal twins: develoepd from two different fertilized egg, like siblings, share on average half theri genetics information
* Twin study by Francis Galton in 1883
  * Compare condordance for disorder between monozygotic twins and fraternal twins
  * Results: Identical twins tend to be more similar (concordant) for neurological and psychiatric traits than fraternal twins, providing evidence of a heritable component of these traits 
* Minnesota Twin Study
  *  Examined identical twins that were separated early in life
  *  Results: despite great different in enviroment, they still share same psychiatric disorders and ends to share personalities.

* Limitation: Twin study does not tell us which genetic and enviromental factors are influence behavior
  * this is addressed by experimental animal and modern method on gene discovery
