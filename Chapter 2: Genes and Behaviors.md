# Introduction
* Behaviors are shaped by the interpaly of genes and enviroment
* RNA and proteins encoded by genes affect brains - at different times and at many levels,
  * e.g. developmental program, synapes' neural circuit function
* Goal of the chapter: How genes contribute to behavior
* Chapter Abstract
  1. Overview of the evidence that genese influcence behavior
  2. review basic principal of molecular biology and genetic transmission
  3. Examples
  4. Recent progress

# Evidence that genese influcence behavior 
* **Twin studies**
  * Monozygotic twins: Identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg, share all genes
  * Fraternal twins: develoepd from two different fertilized egg, like siblings, share on average half theri genetics information
* Twin study by Francis Galton in 1883
 * Compare condordance for disorder between monozygotic twins and fraternal twins
 * Results: Identical twins tend to be more similar (concordant) for neurological and psychiatric traits than fraternal twins, providing evidence of a heritable component of these traits 
* Minnesota Twin Study
